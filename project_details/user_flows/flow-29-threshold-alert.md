### Flow 29: Threshold Alert (Merged into Flow 28)

Flow 29’s responsibilities (detecting usage/failure/cost threshold breaches and notifying stakeholders) are now part of **Flow 28: Usage Sync & Threshold Alerts**. Refer to that flow for the consolidated design. No separate implementation exists for Flow 29 in v1.
