            <p>
              WRK will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer and its officers, directors, employees, and agents (each, a “Customer Indemnitee”) from and against any and all Losses incurred by a Customer Indemnitee arising out of or relating to any claim, action, demand, inquiry, audit, proceeding, or investigation of any nature, civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory, or other, whether at law, in equity or otherwise (collectively, an “Action”) by a third party (other than an Affiliate of a Customer Indemnitee) that arise from or relate to any allegation that the WRK Automation Platform infringes any third-party Intellectual Property Right in Canada or the United States. The foregoing obligation does not apply to any Action or Losses arising out of or relating to any (the “Excluded Claims”): (i) incorporation of the WRK Automation Platform into, or any combination, operation, or use of the WRK Automation Platform with, any products or services not provided or authorized by WRK, unless such infringement would also have resulted solely from the use of the WRK Automation Platform without their incorporation in, or combination, operation or use, with such other products or services; (ii) modification of the WRK Automation Platform other than by WRK or with WRK’s express written approval; or (iii) unauthorized use of the WRK Automation Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the WRK Automation Platform is, or in WRK’s opinion is likely to be, claimed to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party Intellectual Property Right, or if Customer’s use of the WRK Automation Platform is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, WRK may, at its option and sole cost and expense: (i) obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the WRK Automation Platform materially as contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) modify or replace the WRK Automation Platform, in whole or in part, to seek to make the WRK Automation Platform (as so modified or replaced) non-infringing while providing materially equivalent features and functionality, in which case such modifications or replacements will constitute the WRK Automation Platform under this Agreement; or (iii) if WRK determines that neither of the foregoing two options are reasonably available, by written notice to Customer, terminate this Agreement and require Customer to immediately cease all use of the WRK Automation Platform or part or feature thereof.
            </p>
            <p className="font-semibold">d. Customer Indemnity.</p>
            <p>
              Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless WRK, its employees, officers, directors, affiliates, agents, contractors, successors, and assigns (each, a “WRK Indemnitee”) against any and all Losses incurred by a WRK Indemnitee arising out of or relating to: (i) Customer Data; (ii) Customer’s breach of the Restrictions on Use set forth in Section 2(c) or the Customer Warranty set forth in Section 10(a); (iii) Excluded Claims; or (iv) the Deliverables.
